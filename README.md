# KidLit Swap

![Home Page](documentation/home-page.png)

KidLit Swap, derived from Kids' Literature Swap, is a vibrant online community where parents unite to share and exchange children's books. Originating from conversations among parents at my kids' school, it serves as a virtual clubhouse celebrating the enchantment of storytelling in the digital era.

KidLit Swap's purpose is clear â€“ to encourage the sharing and borrowing of kids' literature, fostering a love for reading in young minds. You can share your favorite stories, borrow books from others, and be part of our growing library. It's a fun way to help your kids become great readers.

Join KidLit Swap and let's make reading magical for our little ones!

## Design

KidLit Swap's design is intentionally crafted to be simple and clean, ensuring a user-friendly virtual library for sharing children's books and creating an enjoyable experience.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme for KidLit Swap features lively shades of green, blue, and red, creating a vibrant and playful atmosphere for the children's literature-sharing website. 

In my CSS file, I employed variables to define colors and consistently applied them across the entire stylesheet. It enables easy color updates throughout the website by modifying the color once in the variable, maintaining consistency across the design.

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colors and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility, confirmed through the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

The color palette was generated using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

![Coolors](documentation/readme_images/design/color_scheme.png)

### Imagery

The images utilized in KidLit Swap were generated by [Lexica Art](https://lexica.art/) and sourced from [Oxford Owl](https://www.oxfordowl.co.uk/). Additionally, users will be able to upload their own images for their respective books. Moreover, I created the logo using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Credits for the images can be found in the "Credits" section.

### Typography

In KidLit Swap, the following fonts, obtained from Google Fonts, were carefully chosen to enhance the overall visual appeal:

- [Potta One](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=KidLit%20Swap&query=potta+one) for Header:
  - Cursive font
  - Provides a playful and inviting feel, catering to a kid-friendly atmosphere.

![Potta One](documentation/readme_images/design/potta_one.png)

- [Shantell Sans](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=KidLit%20Swap&query=Shantell+Sans) for Content:
  - Sans-serif font
  - A clean and elegant font, contributing to a pleasant reading experience, maintaining a friendly and playful tone throughout the platform.

![Shantell Sans](documentation/readme_images/design/shantell_sans.png)

These font choices, with a focus on being kid-friendly and playful, aim to create a visually appealing and enjoyable interface for users engaging with KidLit Swap.

### Wireframes

I utilized Balsamiq to design the wireframes for the website.

## Agile Methodology

GitHub Projects was utilized to facilitate the development process following an agile methodology. You can refer to the project board through this [link](https://github.com/users/IzabellaLopes/projects/2).

The 7 Epics mentioned earlier were documented as Milestones within the GitHub project. Each User Story was represented by a GitHub Issue, which was subsequently assigned to a milestone (Epic). Clear acceptance criteria were defined for each User Story to indicate when it is considered complete. Furthermore, these acceptance criteria were detailed into tasks, streamlining the execution of each User Story.

## Data Model

I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.




The diagram below details the database schema.

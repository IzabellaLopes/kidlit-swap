# KidLit Swap

![Home Page](documentation/home-page.png)

KidLit Swap, derived from Kids' Literature Swap, is a vibrant online community where parents unite to share and exchange children's books. Originating from conversations among parents at my kids' school, it serves as a virtual clubhouse celebrating the enchantment of storytelling in the digital era.

KidLit Swap's purpose is clear â€“ to encourage the sharing and borrowing of kids' literature, fostering a love for reading in young minds. You can share your favorite stories, borrow books from others, and be part of our growing library. It's a fun way to help your kids become great readers.

Join KidLit Swap and let's make reading magical for our little ones!

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here]()

The  Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model

I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

# KidLit Swap

![Home Page](documentation/readme_images/features/devices.png)

KidLit Swap, derived from Kids' Literature Swap, is a vibrant online community where parents unite to share and exchange children's books. 

Originating from conversations among parents at my kids' school, it serves as a virtual clubhouse celebrating the enchantment of storytelling in the digital era. Our initial concept involves gathering every first Saturday of the month at the school to kick off our tradition of swapping children's books. Soon, I plan to introduce a feature where the book's owner will be notified about a loan request and can coordinate a convenient location and time for both parties.

KidLit Swap's purpose is clear â€“ to encourage the sharing and borrowing of kids' literature, fostering a love for reading in young minds. You can share your favorite stories, borrow books from others, and be part of our growing library. It's a fun way to help your kids become great readers.

Join KidLit Swap and let's make reading magical for our little ones!

## Design

KidLit Swap's design is intentionally crafted to be simple and clean, ensuring a user-friendly virtual library for sharing children's books and creating an enjoyable experience.

### Color Scheme

The color scheme for KidLit Swap features lively shades of green, blue, and red, creating a vibrant and playful atmosphere for the children's literature-sharing website. 

In my CSS file, I employed variables to define colors and consistently applied them across the entire stylesheet. It enables easy color updates throughout the website by modifying the color once in the variable, maintaining consistency across the design.

Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colors and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility, confirmed through the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

The color palette was generated using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

![Coolors](documentation/readme_images/design/color_scheme.png)

### Imagery

The images utilized in KidLit Swap were generated by [Lexica Art](https://lexica.art/) and sourced from [Oxford Owl](https://www.oxfordowl.co.uk/). Additionally, users will be able to upload their own images for their respective books. Moreover, I created the logo using [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). Credits for the images can be found in the "Credits" section.

### Typography

In KidLit Swap, the following fonts, obtained from Google Fonts, were carefully chosen to enhance the overall visual appeal:

- [Potta One](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=KidLit%20Swap&query=potta+one) for Header:
  - Cursive font
  - Provides a playful and inviting feel, catering to a kid-friendly atmosphere.

![Potta One](documentation/readme_images/design/potta_one.png)

- [Shantell Sans](https://fonts.google.com/?preview.text=KidLit%20Swap&query=Shantell+Sans) for Content:
  - Sans-serif font
  - A clean and elegant font, contributing to a pleasant reading experience, maintaining a friendly and playful tone throughout the platform.

![Shantell Sans](documentation/readme_images/design/shantell_sans.png)

These font choices, with a focus on being kid-friendly and playful, aim to create a visually appealing and enjoyable interface for users engaging with KidLit Swap.

### Wireframes

I utilized Balsamiq to design the wireframes for the website.

## Agile Methodology

GitHub Projects was utilized to facilitate the development process following an agile methodology. You can refer to the project board through this [link](https://github.com/users/IzabellaLopes/projects/2).

The 7 Epics mentioned earlier were documented as Milestones within the GitHub project. Each User Story was represented by a GitHub Issue, which was subsequently assigned to a milestone (Epic). Clear acceptance criteria were defined for each User Story to indicate when it is considered complete. Furthermore, these acceptance criteria were detailed into tasks, streamlining the execution of each User Story.

## Data Model

The data model for the KidLit Swap project follows principles of Object-Oriented Programming and leverages Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views. Django AllAuth is employed for the user authentication system.

To enable users to contribute to the community, a custom Book model was implemented. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, description, image, and category. The 'added_by' field links to the User model, ensuring that each book has a dedicated owner.

Additionally, the project incorporates features such as borrowing and returning books. The Book model includes fields for 'status,' 'borrower,' and 'return_date,' facilitating a streamlined book borrowing system. Users can view their borrowed books and manage their book inventory through dedicated views.

The database schema is structured to provide a robust foundation for the KidLit Swap platform:

## Security Features and Defensive Design

In the KidLit Swap project, robust user authentication and security features have been implemented to ensure a secure and reliable user experience.

### User Authentication

In KidLit Swap, I've implemented robust security measures for user authentication.

- LoginRequiredMixin: Employing Django's `LoginRequiredMixin`, any attempt by non-authenticated users to access secure pages results in an automatic redirection to the login page. This ensures that sensitive sections of the application are accessible only to authenticated users.

- UserPassesTestMixin: To finely control access based on specific permissions, I utilize Django's `UserPassesTestMixin`. For example, users can only perform actions like adding books, borrowing books, or returning books if they meet certain criteria. If a user fails these tests, a clear HTTP 403 Forbidden error is displayed, maintaining a secure environment.

### Form Validation

I've implemented thorough form validation mechanisms to enhance data integrity.

- If incorrect or empty data is detected in a form submission, the form prevents submission, and a user-friendly warning appears. This approach ensures that users receive prompt feedback about the specific fields causing errors.

### Database Security

My approach to database security prioritizes confidentiality and protection against unauthorized access.

- The database URL and secret key are stored in a separate env.py file, preventing unintended database connections. This practice was established before the initial push to Github, safeguarding sensitive information.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

KidLit Swap employs CSRF tokens on all forms throughout the site, providing an additional layer of defense against cross-site request forgery attacks.

### Custom Error Pages

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request: The KidLit Swap is unable to process a request, providing a clear message to the user.
- 403 Forbidden: In cases of attempting to access forbidden content, the user is guided to log out and sign in to the correct account through a custom 403 Forbidden page.
- 404 Not Found: A custom 404 page assists users in navigating back to the site when the requested page doesn't exist.
- 500 Internal Server Error:  During server errors, users are informed through a custom 500 Internal Server Error, helping them understand the temporary unavailability of certain functionalities.

### Home Page

#### Hero Call-to-Action section

The home page features a hero call-to-action with the title 'KidLit Swap: Exchange the Magic of Kids' Literature' and an animated jumping image. 

- For non-logged-in users, an invitation encourages signing up for a chance to 'Join, share, borrow, and let the enchanting adventures begin!'. It includes a 'Sign Up' button leading to the sign up page.

![Hero](documentation/readme_images/features/hero.png)

- When logged in, the message transforms to 'Welcome back to KidLit Swap!' and prompts the user to add a new book. The sign up button is replaced with an 'Add Book' button, directing the user to the 'Add Book' page.

#### Log In
![Log in](documentation/readme_images/features/login.png)

#### Log Out
![Log out](documentation/readme_images/features/logout.png)


### Book List

![Book List](documentation/readme_images/features/book_list.png)

- The Book List page in this project showcases an organized collection of books, arranged alphabetically, with a priority on available books.
- Pagination breaks down the book cards into sets of eight for user-friendly navigation.
- Each card provides key details such as the book's image, title, author, status (available or borrowed), and the book's owner (added by).
- A simple click anywhere on a book card directs users to the detailed page for that specific book.

- Located at the top left is a category box, offering users the convenience of selecting a category and being redirected to a dedicated page for filtered book results.
  ![Book List - Category](documentation/readme_images/features/category.png)

- Towards the bottom of the page, an engaging section encourages users to actively participate in the community by adding more books. If a user is logged in, a personalized greeting saying 'Hello username! Do you want to add a book to our library?' is prominently displayed. This makes it easier for users and encourages them to be a part of the community.
  ![Book List - Add Book](documentation/readme_images/features/book_list_auth.png)

### Book Details

- The Book Details page displays comprehensive information about the book, including title, author, description, category, status, and the owner of the book (added by).

- Additionally, the page features four types of messages in the bottom corner:
  - If the user is not logged in and the status is Available, a prompt will appear: "Do you want to borrow this book?" along with a Log In button to redirect the user to the log in page.
 ![Book Details - Non logged](documentation/readme_images/features/detail_nonlogged.png)

  - If the logged-in user is the owner of the book (added by) and the status is Available, a message will express gratitude for sharing the book ("Thank you for sharing your book on KidLit Swap!").
  ![Book Details - Owner](documentation/readme_images/features/detail_owner.png)

  - If the logged-in user is not the owner of the book and the status is Available, a "Borrow This Book" button will appear.
  ![Book Details - User](documentation/readme_images/features/detail_user.png)

  - Clicking this button redirects the user to a modal for confirming borrowing details, including selecting a return date. Upon confirmation, the book's status changes from Available to Borrowed, and the message updates accordingly.
  ![Modal - Return date](documentation/readme_images/features/return_date.png)

  - If the logged-in user has borrowed the book, the message will state, "This book is currently borrowed by [username] and is expected to be returned on [date selected in the modal]."
  ![Book Details - Borrowed](documentation/readme_images/features/detail_borrowed.png)

- Finally, there is a button labeled "Back to Book List" to redirect the user back to the Book List page.

### Category

![Category Books](documentation/readme_images/features/category_book.png)

- As mentioned earlier, users can filter their book selection using the "Select a Category" option on the Book List page. This will redirect them to the Book - {Category name} page, which displays all books belonging to that specific category.
- Finally, there is a button labeled "Back to Book List" to redirect the user back to the Book List page.

### Manage Books | My Books

- The My Books page can be accessed within the "Manage Books" dropdown, available only to logged-in users.
- Initially, my project aimed to include both "Added Books" and "Borrowed Books" on the same page. However, as users added more books, the page became cluttered, impacting user experience. Throughout the project, I chose to use large cards with prominent images, given the child-oriented nature of the site. Consequently, I decided to separate the sections. 
- The My Books page now displays all books added by the logged-in user, featuring three buttons with associated Font Awesome icons: "View Details," "Edit," and "Delete."
  ![My Books](documentation/readme_images/features/my_books.png)

- Clicking "View Details":
  - Redirects the user to the "Book Details" page.
  ![View details](documentation/readme_images/features/view_details.png)

- Clicking "Edit":
  - Redirects the user to the "Edit Book" page, where the owner of the book can modify book details such as Title, Author, Description, Image, and Category. If no image is added, a placeholder image created using an image from Lexica and designed on Canva will be loaded. Additionally, users can add a new category if desired. The page includes a "Save Changes" button at the bottom.
  ![Edit book](documentation/readme_images/features/edit_book.png)

- Clicking "Delete":
  - When the book status is available, redirects the user to the "Delete Book" page. A red alert message prompts the user to confirm the deletion: "Are you sure you want to delete the book 'TITLE OF THE BOOK'?"
  - The page includes buttons with Font Awesome icons: "Delete" and "Cancel." Clicking "Delete" removes the book from the database, while clicking "Cancel" redirects the user to the "My Books" page. 
  ![Delete book](documentation/readme_images/features/delete_book.png)

  - If the book is borrowed, attempting to delete will display an error message: "You cannot delete this book because it is borrowed to {username}."
  ![Error - Delete book](documentation/readme_images/features/error_delete.png)


### Manage Books | Borrowed Books

- The Borrowed Books page is personalized for each logged-in user, displaying the borrowed books. 
- The information presented includes the book title, the owner of the book (added by), and the return date (previously selected by the logged user in the modal).
  ![Borrowed books](documentation/readme_images/features/borrowed_books.png)

- At the bottom of each card, there is a "Return Book" button with its respective Font Awesome icon. 
- Upon clicking, a success message appears at the top of the page, stating "You have successfully returned the book 'TITLE OF THE BOOK'." 
  ![Success message - Borrowed books](documentation/readme_images/features/borrowed_books_msg.png)

- Additionally, the book will be removed from the "Borrowed Books" section, and its status will be changed from "Borrowed" back to "Available."


### Manage Books | Add Book

- The Add Book page presents a form for users to contribute a new book to KidLit Swap.
- The required fields include title, author, and description, while image and category are optional. 
  ![Add book](documentation/readme_images/features/add_book.png)
- If the user wishes to add a new image, they can choose one from their files, which will be stored on Cloudinary. In the absence of a user-selected image, a default image, created by me and featuring the title "KidLit Swap," will be displayed.

  ![Placeholder image](documentation/readme_images/features/placeholder_img.png)

- Regarding the category, users can pick from a dropdown menu containing previously added categories or introduce a new one by filling in the "Do you want to add a new category?" field. If no category is selected, the default category will be set to "None."
- Clicking the "Add Book" button will insert the book into the Book List.

### Profile

The profile page consists of three sections:

- Welcome, username!

- Books Added: Displays a message "You've added x books to the library," where x represents the number of books the user has added to KidLit Swap. Additionally, there is a "View My Books" button that redirects the user to the "My Books" page.

- Books Borrowed: Displays a message "You've borrowed x books," where x represents the number of books the user has borrowed from other users. There is also a "View Borrowed Books" button that redirects the user to the "Borrowed Books" page.

### Error Pages

As mentioned earlier, Custom Error Pages were designed to offer users additional information about the error and provide them with buttons for navigating back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request: 
  ![400](documentation/readme_images/features/400.png)

- 403 Forbidden:
  ![403](documentation/readme_images/features/403.png)

- 404 Not Found: 
  ![404](documentation/readme_images/features/404.png)

- 500 Internal Server Error: 
  ![500](documentation/readme_images/features/500.png)


### Future Implementations

As mentioned earlier in [EPIC: Future Features](https://github.com/IzabellaLopes/kidlit-swap/milestone/7), certain user stories have been omitted from the current project due to time constraints. They are marked as "Won't Have" on the GitHub project board with plans for future implementation.

In addition to the user stories outlined in the "Future Features," I also plan to implement two additional features in the future:

1. Develop an alert system to notify the owner of a book (added by) when someone requests to borrow the book and suggest a loan date. This way, the owner can approve or reject the loan, provide details about the book's pickup location, and the response will be sent back to the logged-in user.

2. Create a search bar to allow users to easily locate a book in the Book List.
